## Work Done So Far
* Basically worked through Chapter 1 of the Nielson Book (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). Written in python2 so a few adjustments needed. Run nielson_book/main.py via the virtual environment:

```shell
cd nielson_book
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then run the example:
python main.py
```
